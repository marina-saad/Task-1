        <h1>What is jQuery?</h1>
        <pre>jQuery is a lightweight, "writeless, do more", JavaScript library. 
            <br>The Purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
            <br>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and warps them into methods that you CAN Call with a single line of code.
            <br>jQuery also simplifies a ot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation. <br>
        </pre>

    <div id="Angular">
        <h1>What is Angular?</h1>
        <pre>Angular is a platform and framework for building sinfle-page client application using HTML and TypeScript.
            <br>Angular is written in TypeScriipt it implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypScript libraries that you import into your apps. 
            <br>The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts.
            <br>The basic building blocks are NgModules, which provide a copilation context for components. 
            <br>NgModulea collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules.
            <br>An app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules. 
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data. </li>
            <li>Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Both components and services are simply classes, with decoratorsthat mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that defines a view. A template Contains ordinary HTML with Angular directives and bindings markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before 
                rendering it for display </li>
                <li>The metadata for a service class provides the information Angulare needs to make it available to components through dependency injection (DJ).</li>
